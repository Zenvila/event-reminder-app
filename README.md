# 

# \---

# 

# \## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

# 

# \### Local Storage Architecture

# All events are stored locally using `shared\_preferences` as serialized JSON strings. The `EventStorageService` class provides clean CRUD operations:

# \- `getEvents()` — Load all events from device storage

# \- `addEvent()` — Save a new event

# \- `updateEvent()` — Update an existing event

# \- `deleteEvent()` — Remove an event by ID

# 

# \### Notification System

# Events use `flutter\_local\_notifications` with timezone-aware scheduling via the `timezone` package. Notifications are:

# \- Scheduled at the exact event date and time

# \- Cancelled automatically when events are deleted

# \- Rescheduled when events are edited

# \- Persisted across app restarts

# 

# \### Offline First Design

# This app is designed to work completely without internet. All data lives on the device. No Firebase, no Google Sign-In, no cloud sync, no API calls.

# 

# \### Theme System

# Dark and light modes are managed by `ThemeProvider` using Flutter's `ThemeMode`. User preference is persisted across sessions.

# 

# \---

# 

# \## 📋 How to Use

# 

# \### Creating Your First Event

# 1\. Launch the app and enter your name on the login screen

# 2\. Complete the onboarding (first launch only)

# 3\. Tap the \*\*+\*\* floating action button on the home screen

# 4\. Fill in the event title (required)

# 5\. Add location, description (optional)

# 6\. Pick a date using the date picker

# 7\. Pick a time using the time picker

# 8\. Toggle notifications ON if you want a reminder

# 9\. Tap \*\*Create Event\*\*

# 

# \### Viewing Events

# \- \*\*All tab\*\* — shows every event you have created

# \- \*\*Upcoming tab\*\* — shows future events only

# \- \*\*Past tab\*\* — shows events that have already passed

# \- \*\*Calendar tab\*\* — tap any date to see events on that day

# 

# \### Managing Events

# \- Tap the \*\*edit icon\*\* on any event card to modify it

# \- Tap the \*\*delete icon\*\* to permanently remove an event

# \- Pull down to refresh the events list

# 

# \### Settings

# \- Toggle \*\*Dark Mode\*\* for a darker interface

# \- Toggle \*\*Notifications\*\* to enable or disable all reminders

# \- Tap \*\*Clear All Events\*\* to delete everything

# \- Tap \*\*Sign Out\*\* to return to the login screen
